# Simple Message Sender Script

This Python script allows you to send messages to a specific URL endpoint via HTTP POST requests. The script includes a simple method for sending a single message and a commented-out section for spamming the endpoint with continuous messages. It uses the `requests` library for making HTTP requests and the `terminut` logging module for logging success or failure of the message delivery.
